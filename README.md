Arduino Lighthouse LED Strobe

In elementary school, my daughter built a lighthouse model.  We used a Teensy to make the LED strobe at the proper speed.

I can't claim this is particularly elegant code, but then it was written by a fourth grader who had not previously touched a compiler.
Including in my repository because she doesn't have a repository of her own... yet.
